# Policies

## Adding Members
- Members should be (or have been) residents of Utah
- Members must be iOS developers (to any degree)
- Members should provide their real names in their profiles
- Members should be welcomed (https://gist.github.com/armadsen/a6ee42b5cca667e52206)
  - we may eventually have a bot for this

## General
- Record all complaints from users, for posterity

## Removing Members
- The decision to kick someone out of the group requires unanimous approval from all admins
  - ambivalent approval is insufficient; the admins must be in agreement that the user is detrimental to the group
- Prior to removal, the user must be given the opportunity to apologize/make amends/reform.
  - in general, we'll follow a "three strikes" pattern. However, even after three "strikes", the decision to remove the user must still be unanimous.
