Welcome to the Utah iOS and Mac Developers Slack Team! Here's some info to get you started:

First things first. You should introduce yourself in #introductions. Tell us a little bit about who you are and what you do. We also like it if people add a profile picture so we can tell who's who.

We have a lot of different channels here. You should explore them and join those that interest you. A few to get you started:

#lobby - General discussion on just about anything.
#xcode - For help with, and discussions of Xcode and related tools. :xcode:
#swift - For discussion of Swift! :swift:
#code - For general programming questions.
#radar - Post and discuss bugs you file with Apple (or the Swift team). :radar: 
#shipped - For announcing when you've shipped a cool new app, library, or other project.
#jobs - For posting and finding job opportunities.
#meta - For questions or comments about the group itself. You can use this group to request that Utah iOS or Mac developer friends be invited to the team. :slack:

Meetups: A number of us get together in person at various times. We coordinate through these channels:
- Occasional lunch get-togethers: #lehi-lunch, #slc-lunch, and #provo-orem-lunch
- CocoaHeads groups: #cocoaheads-uv and #cocoaheads-slc
- Weekly, casual meetups: #nscoders-lehi, #nscoders-orem, #uicoders-slc, and #nscoders-logan

There are also a whole bunch of specialized channels, like #politics, #religion, #holywar, #machine-learning, #marketing... Be sure to check out the full channel list.

We don't have many rules. They basically are:
- Be nice. This goes without saying, but we want this to be a friendly, inviting place.
- This group is for Mac and iOS developers with a Utah connnection, whether you're a beginner or an expert. We like this to be a place free of recruiters and business types :).

If you have a question, need assistance with the group, or need to report a problem, please contact one of the admins in a DM. The admins are: @armadsen, @bwhiteley, @bjhomer, @clifton, @dave, @mark, @marks, @miles, and @parker .

Again, welcome!
