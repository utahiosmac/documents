Welcome to the Utah iOS and Mac Developers Slack Team! Here's some info to get you started:

First things first. You should introduce yourself in #introductions. Tell us a little bit about who you are and what you do. We also like it if people add a profile picture so we can tell who's who.

We have a lot of different channels here. You should explore them and join those that interest you. A few to get you started:

#lobby - General discussion about just about anything.
#xcode - For help with, and discussions of Xcode and related tools.
#swift - For discussion of Swift!
#objc - For discussion of Objective-C!
#radar - Post and discuss bugs you file with Apple (or the Swift team).
#shipped - For announcing when you've shipped a cool new app, library, or other project.
#jobs - For posting and finding job opportunities.
#please-add - Post here to request that Utah iOS or Mac devleoper friends be invited to the team.

Meetups: A number of us get together in person at various times. We coordinate through these channels:

#lehi-lunch - For lunch get togethers on Mondays (or other days).
#cocoaheads-slc - Monthly CocoaHeads meetings in Salt Lake.
#cocoaheads-uv - Monthly CocoaHeads meetings in Lehi.
#nscoders-lehi - Weekly, casual meetups in Lehi.
#nscoders-provo - Weekly, casual meetups in Provo.
#uicoders-slc - Weekly, casual meetups in Salt Lake City.
#nscoders-logan - Weekly, casual meetups in Logan.

We don't have many rules. They basically are:

- Be nice. This goes without saying, but we want this to be a friendly, inviting place.
- This group is for Mac and iOS developers with a Utah connnection, whether you're a beginner or an expert. We like this to be a place free of recruiters and business types :).

If you have a question, need assistance with the group, or need to report a problem, please contact one of the admins in a DM. The admins are: @armadsen, @dave, @bjhomer, @clifton, @bwhiteley, @marks, @miles, and @parker .

Again, welcome!
